# Architectures to build. The first one will always be used for 'full'
# builds, i.e. arch-dep, arch-indep and source.
# Following architectures buildds will be used only for arch-dep builds.
BUILD_ON = [
	"amd64",

# Extra Debian repositories to add. These can be used to pull packages
# from other feature branches.
# Note that builds with EXTRA_REPOS won't start on production or staging.
EXTRA_REPOS = []

# Host architecture. This can be used to instruct the buildd to
# assume the packages are built (host -> should be executed on) for the
# specified architecture. This is useful for cross-builds.
# You will probably want to leave this value as None (the default) unless
# you know what you're doing.
#
# Note that when HOST_ARCH is not None, builds will be created only
# for the first architecture specified in BUILD_ON.
#
# For example, taking in account the following:
#     BUILD_ON = ["amd64"]
#     HOST_ARCH = "arm64"
# The buildd infrastructure will build on amd64 targetting arm64.
HOST_ARCH = "arm64"
